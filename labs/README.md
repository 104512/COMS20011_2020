# COMS20011_2020 Labs

The labs are all Jupyter Notebooks.  Please get set up with them as soon as possible.

There are two basic options: remotely logging in to a lab machine.  Or locally installing Python (not supported).

## Remote access to MVB machines

* Option 1 - Follow these guidelines provided by IT Services: [Linux Remote Desktop](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/fits-engineering-linux-x2go.aspx)

* Option 2 (advanced) - If you are running an X server already (i.e. because you're running Linux locally), then open a shell on your machine, and type this command: 
```
ssh -X -J youruserid@seis.bris.ac.uk youruserid@rd-mvb-linuxlab.bristol.ac.uk
```
