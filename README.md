## Structure
Lecture videos for a week will be released on Monday and posted here.  Please take a look at them promptly!

The coursework will be 40% of the mark and the exam will be 60% (deadlines TBA).

TA led sessions on Thursday 3-5 are the main route for feedback on all aspects of the course: lectures, labs and coursework.  These will start on 11th Feb, and you will be assigned a group by email before then.

There will be "lab" exercises released in the "lab" folder.  Please do them promptly and bring any questions to the TA-led sessions: the coursework is heavily based on the labs!
